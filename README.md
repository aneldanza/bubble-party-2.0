## Description

Bubble Party is a fun and addictive game inspired by the classic Bubble Shooter arcade game and the SpongeBob cartoon. In this engaging experience, players aim to pop bubbles and score points. The game begins with a single player, and bubbles of various colors continuously appear from the top of the screen. To score, players must match and hit bubbles that are adjacent to two or more bubbles of the same color.

There are two exciting play modes: Relaxed mode for a laid-back experience and Time-Limit mode for those who love a challenge.

Bubble Party features a responsive design, making it fully compatible with desktop, tablet, and mobile browsers for a smooth and enjoyable gaming experience anywhere.
